          <div class="learned-title">What I Learned:</div>
          <div class="learned-text">
            During my internship at OneShot.ai, I learned how to thrive in a fast-paced startup environment by
            balancing speed with thoughtful planning. I gained hands-on experience across the full stack and worked
            on core AI systems, which taught me how to break down complex problems, design scalable architectures,
            and iterate quickly without sacrificing quality.
            <p></p>
            I learned the value of modular, flexible
            code—especially when refactoring systems to support multiple AI providers—and saw how small technical
            decisions can have a big impact on long-term maintainability.
            <p></p>
            Most importantly, I learned how to be
            adaptable: wearing multiple hats, diving into unfamiliar tech, and contributing meaningfully across the
            stack while collaborating closely with a small, focused team.

            Working on AthlEATe was a pivotal early experience that helped me connect technical development with
            real product thinking. As a co-founder, I wasn’t just building features—I was helping shape a vision. I
            developed a React Native prototype that used OpenAI’s GPT API to generate personalized meal plans, which
            gave me early exposure to integrating LLMs into user-facing apps. Presenting our product to Silicon
            Valley executives and getting validation on its technical and market potential taught me how to
            communicate value clearly and think critically about user needs.
            <p></p>
            This experience laid the groundwork for my internship at OneShot.ai, where I expanded on those skills by
