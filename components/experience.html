          <div class="learned-title">What I Learned:</div>
          <div class="learned-text">
            During my internship at OneShot.ai, I learned how to thrive in a fast-paced startup environment by
            balancing speed with thoughtful planning. I gained hands-on experience across the full stack and worked
            on core AI systems, which taught me how to break down complex problems, design scalable architectures,
            and iterate quickly without sacrificing quality.
            <p></p>
            I learned the value of modular, flexible
            code—especially when refactoring systems to support multiple AI providers—and saw how small technical
            decisions can have a big impact on long-term maintainability.
            <p></p>
            Most importantly, I learned how to be
            adaptable: wearing multiple hats, diving into unfamiliar tech, and contributing meaningfully across the
            stack while collaborating closely with a small, focused team.

              frontend or type regressions—enhancing modularity and maintainability.
            </li>
            <li class="learned-text">Built a full-stack application with React, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB
              following MVC and deployed on AWS Lightsail.</li>
            <li class="learned-text">Implemented real-time WebSocket integration between LLMs and a voice agent to
              support scalable automated voice sessions.</li>
            <li class="learned-text">Constructed an ML pipeline by connecting webhooks to ingest real-time data and
              use the data to generate insights that improved product usage.
